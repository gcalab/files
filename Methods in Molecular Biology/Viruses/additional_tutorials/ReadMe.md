# Superimposing Structures in UCSF Chimera
> [!NOTE]
> This is the guide for superimposing structures in Chimera and saving the PDB files after superposition for further analysis either for Structural Validation using [LGA](http://proteinmodel.org/AS2TS/LGA/lga.html) or for slicing out PDB regions for analysis with [US-align](https://aideepmed.com/US-align/).
